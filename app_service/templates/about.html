        <p class="abouttext"> With the two worlds of Gas and Avanade, we present to you: Gavanade! <br><br>
        We are a group of enthuastic software engineering interns with a passion for learning and creating projects that put our skills to the test! By utilizing our team work and strengths,
        we put together a small yet conventional website where you can find the average gas prices based on your zipcode. 
        Fun fact: this is each of our first time participating in Avanade's summer internship. </p>

<p class="abouttext"> Hi, my name is Ryan Taylor. I am a senior at Georgia State University in pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. 
    I genuinely enjoy technology so a lot of my free-time is devoted to tinkering around with my Arch Linux desktop environment. Another hobby of mine is playing the tenor saxophone. 
    I was in band throughout high school and despite not being in band during college, I still make an effort to play my instrument when I can.</p>
